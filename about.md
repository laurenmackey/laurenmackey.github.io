<p>I'm Lauren. I'm a native Californian who is currently forgoing the 9 to 5 lifestyle for a bit of an adventure through South and Central America. I'm very interested in the structure of cities, urban development in general, data visualization and the intersection between all of these things. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, speaking Spanish and making maps.</p>
