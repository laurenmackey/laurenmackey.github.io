<p>Hello! I'm Lauren. I currently live in Berkeley, California where I work for an education company and study Computer Science on the side. I like to travel, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21537778-lauren" target="_blank">read</a>, play tennis, and explore new running trails. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk data visualization, delicious food, or taking a year off to travel (highly recommended!).
