*Sucre, Bolivia*

I have been traveling around South America for two and a half months now and would consider myself in a bit of a limbo period between the “vacation” form of travel and that of the long-term variety. Below are some reflections on what can be garnered and learned from a stint of travel for this length of time.

How to budget effectively in order to maximize your goal. 
------------------
For me, this has been quite the learning process. I have learned that I personally want to maximize the goal of being able to travel for as long as possible, so to do that, I need to be better about budgeting. I’m getting there, but am still not perfect. However, I’ve learned that setting a reasonable daily budget and then making conscious choices throughout the day is crucial for me. 


How you personally like to spend your money.
------------------
Related to the point above, when you financially constrain yourself, you learn what things are truly worth it to you to spend your meager daily allowance on. Is it that extra coffee? Or do you wait all day because you know you’re going to spend a lot of money on the night out that awaits you? For me, it is food and drinks, but particularly food. I am a sucker for roadside pastries, various market foods and of course that coveted, mouth-watering, Western burger. I’ve learned this is what I like to spend my money on and have adjusted my spending on other things accordingly. I've also tried to up my will-power efforts to minimize consumption when not necessary (although I too often fail at this).


The balancing act between indulgence and self-constraint. 
------------------
It’s crazy how “hungry” you think you are or how much you want to spend your money when you don’t have something to do during the day. When I was working full time, I was distracted for the majority of the day, and when I got home I found I would either splurge on a nice dinner and drinks or I’d go to the other extreme and just lounge around my apartment, not spending any money. Now that I don’t have any sort of set daily schedule and can do really anything with my free time, I have a tendency to try to structure my days around either set things to do, which oftentimes means things to spend money on, or meals. I know myself well enough to know that this is a habit that would be hard to get rid of, and the nature of travel lends itself well to this type of lifestyle, for better or for worse. So instead of trying to change the habit, I have really focused on trying to find the fine line between over-indulgence and painfully unnecessary amounts of self-constraint. I will admit that I tend to err more on the side of over-indulgence, but just the recognition of that fact is something that travel has helped me to achieve and consciously work against.


What you do and don’t like to do. 
------------------
When you travel, you have the power to decide what you do in a day. Because of this, you naturally gravitate towards doing things that you actually want to do and that you truly enjoy. On this trip, I’ve discovered that I do in fact like spending time on the computer – writing, reading the news, discovering new potential projects and looking up cool places in the city I’m visiting. I’ve also realized I really enjoy reading, walking around a city, going to cool coffee shops/bars/restaurants, sitting in parks or plazas and chatting with random people along the way. Lastly, I’ve been surprised to learn that I enjoy being in places that are natural, slow-paced and allow for active adventures like hiking more so than being in cities. I’ve either discovered or been reinforced that I don’t like going to museums, admiring churches, visiting tourist sites unless there’s something extra special about them or looking at ruins unless again they are incredibly amazing. I just don't find those things all that interesting. I also don’t like spending countless hours for days in a row on the computer, or staying in any one place without a routine and concrete things to do for too long. Granted, I knew some of these things about myself already, but some of them I didn’t know. Having your schedule be entirely free of commitments allows you to figure out what you do and don’t like to do in such a way that will hopefully help you shape your future lifestyle going forward.


How much you like to socialize. 
------------------
This one will vary depending on whom you’re traveling with, where you are and the pace of your travel. But for me, this trip has really taught me that I find a comfort in the familiar, that I like to talk to people but not spend my entire day doing so and that I enjoy doing solitary activities for at least part of the day. 


What types of places you like. 
------------------
I’ve been quite shocked to find how much I’ve enjoyed the more relaxing, natural places that allow you to do some physical work rather than the more bustling, city environments. For me, although the physical activities can be grueling in the moment, it’s so rewarding. It’s nice not to have to worry about hitting all the hip spots while you’re visiting a city and instead just enjoying your surroundings and getting some inspiration from nature. Given that I had always considered myself an "urban" person and a true city lover, I don't know what to make of this. Perhaps it's just because the cities within South America that I've seen haven't called to me, or maybe there's a deeper lesson to be learned here, but it's interesting all the same.


How easily you’re able to immerse yourself in other cultures. 
------------------
I’ve found this quite difficult to do, while others seem to be able to do it somewhat easily. This does depend on whether or not you’re traveling alone, but I also feel that even if I was solo, I’d gravitate toward the familiar and the comfortable, at least some of the time. From this trip, I’ve realized it takes a TON of time and motivated, active effort to truly immerse yourself in another culture. On the flip side, when I have made this effort, it has been incredibly fulfilling.


How to problem solve, often on short notice. 
------------------
While traveling long term, you have to make a lot of choices. What route should I take? Should I spend my money on this? Should I take a night bus or wait for the safer but pricier day bus? How long should I stay here? Should I go to see this site or not? What company should I do a tour with? How long do I need to give myself to arrive at the airport on time? How should I deal with the fact that my debit card is lost? They may seem like trivial choices and at the end of the day many of them are, but they do pose a real problem to you at that given moment. Having to make so many decisions on such a constant basis helps teach you how you yourself solve problems, how to better prioritize and structure your choices, how you shouldn’t “sweat the small stuff”, how to be more adaptable and how to learn from bad decisions.
