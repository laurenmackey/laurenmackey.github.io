*Salento, Colombia*

As I was updating my personal website, I found the post I wrote on [What Travel Teaches You][1] back in Sucre. Since I wrote that one when we were only two and a half months into the trip, and we’re now nearly nine and a half months in, I thought it would be interesting to revisit this topic. I’ve thought up some new additions to this list that I’ve really felt have influenced me over these last several months of travel.

Patience.
------------------
When you’re traveling, things won’t always go your way. In fact, sometimes it seems that they’re never going your way. You wait around for your replacement debit card to come, only to be told the address you used wouldn’t accept the shipment and it was sent back. The only bus available to your desired destination leaves at 3am every other Thursday. You get to the campsite and have pulled out all your tent setup materials when it starts pouring rain. After spending 12 hours on a cramped night bus, you get to your hostel, but then find that your room won’t be ready for another six hours. The examples are endless, and some may see these inconveniences and annoyances as a downside to travel. While I’ve had my fair share of frustrating moments and near-meltdowns on this trip, I value the patience these situations have taught me to have. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not a patient person by nature. I like to do things efficiently and get them done in the amount of time that I think it should take. Travel has taught me that this isn’t always possible, and that things are not always in your control. In these instances, learning and exercising patience is the only way to preserve your sanity. While I certainly haven’t perfected this skill, I can say that travel has helped me to realize the power and importance of it.

Communication Skills.
------------------
Stereotypes are an innate part of the human social experience, whether we like it or not. Oftentimes, we form opinions about people or their nationalities before even meeting them. On this trip, I’ve been surrounded by people from all over the world. In order to truly interact with the people around you in a foreign country, whether they are natives or fellow international travelers, keeping an open mind when communicating is crucial. As soon as you allow stereotypes to filter in, you miss out on what could potentially have been a very enriching conversation to have with someone. It may seem like an obvious approach, but I’ve been surprised by how easy it can be to allow preconceptions about someone or where they’re from to affect the way you interact with them. Further, language barriers will always exist when you travel. Rather than shut yourself off to people who you can’t communicate with linguistically, I’ve found it far more rewarding to attempt to communicate with them regardless. I once had an entire series of conversations with someone who couldn’t speak a language I spoke – he talked to me in Portuguese and I responded in Spanish and English. We stumbled through it at times, but he was interesting to talk to and I was glad I made the effort. Even if your foreign language skills are lackluster, people can sense when you are trying and they will respect you for it.

What you Miss from Home.
------------------
I’ve missed surprisingly little from my life back at home, actually. When I studied abroad in Spain, I remember having my American visitors bring me things like goldfish, sour punch straws and fashion magazines. I fantasized about the food I missed, the shows I wanted to watch (Netflix wouldn’t work in Spain at the time) and, of course, the family and friends I wanted to see. While I do miss the latter group this time around, I haven’t been hit with nearly as many longings for other things from home. However, I have found that I do miss the structure of my lifestyle in the US, as well as certain traditions and options that you grow accustomed to in your native country. I have thoroughly enjoyed the travel lifestyle, so much so that I’ve continued on with it for over nine months. I have also seen, though, that it is not a sustainable form of living for me. I like routine and doing fulfilling work – I enjoy waking up at a certain time, having something rewarding to do during the day and feeling like I’m learning something new. While I have learned an immense amount about myself, new places and other cultures on this trip, I’ve found that this type of learning is not enough to keep me fulfilled in the long term. I miss the ability to have a routine, like I had at home. I also miss the chance to work towards something with the people around me. Further, I miss having the options I had available to me at home – it was nice being able to hop in my car to go to the grocery store or to be able to choose from a variety of ethnic restaurants for dinner. Finally, I miss little customs and nostalgic moments from home. Christmas just wasn’t the same without seeing the lit-up houses in Sacramento. It sounds fun to go to the local art museum with my Mom. I miss my runs through Golden Gate Park. Realizing the things you miss from home is nice in a way, though. It makes you appreciate them with a new perspective while also allowing you to realize what you enjoy. In that way, while travel may make you a little homesick or nostalgic at times, it also helps you place value on the things that matter to you most.

That People Around the World are Both Different and Similar. 
------------------
I’ve met people from various countries with widely different upbringings on this trip. When I hear stories of what it’s like to work out in the field for an oil company in the Canadian winter or to start working at age 13 in rural Colombia, I just can’t relate. But for how different people can seem, I’ve also found that there’s a lot about us that is similar. Most everyone I’ve met appreciates travel, either directly for themselves or indirectly by being accepting of you and the fact that you are getting to know their country. And while people have varying levels of warmth and friendliness, most are willing to help you out in a situation where you need it. So yes, people are different. That’s true within an individual family, the city you live in and, of course, in a foreign country. But it’s been surprising to me how many similarities you find if you take the time to talk to and observe people and their customs. 

About New Ideas and Lifestyles. 
------------------
Before this trip, I had never lived on a farm, or spent more than a few nights at a time sleeping in a tent. I had never thought it was an option to travel the world with kids in tow, and I didn’t realize how different family traditions could be from my own. When you travel, you’re exposed to entirely new ideas and ways of doing things that you’ve never experienced before. While I could imagine what it was like to work on a farm, I didn’t actually know what it entailed and how it made you feel until I tried it. And I especially didn’t know what it was like to work on a farm in Chile, surrounded by a family that spoke only Spanish, cooked regional foods, had their own customs and cultivated fruits and vegetables unique to the area. It had never occurred to me that it would be a good idea to put your American kids in a Bolivian school for a year, until I talked to the guy that was doing it. I had never seen first-hand how a Bolivian family unit functioned until I lived and shared meals with one for a week. Getting exposure to new ideas and different types of lifestyles can be a powerful thing. It can open up a whole new world of hobbies or interests for you that you had never considered before. It can cause you to think about your life or the world in a different way. And even if you never choose to incorporate anything you learned from your travels into your life, just knowing that these different things exist makes you a more open-minded and well-rounded person.

How Easy and Cheap it Can Be to See the World. 
------------------
In the past, one of the biggest deterrents to travel for me was the amount of effort and money it took to do it. While it certainly does take some amounts of these things, it takes far less than the typical person assumes. I personally hate reading guidebooks. I find them boring and, to me, a lot of places they describe end up sounding the same. So I simply don’t read them, and I plan my destinations based on things I’ve heard, pictures I’ve seen and activities I want to do. It takes away the stress of trying to decide the ideal route with the limitless options the guidebooks present to you, and therefore makes me far more likely to travel at all. Travel can also be much cheaper than many people think. Unless you are trying to splurge all the time or have a vacation-style trip, it can be decently easy to budget for long-term travel. Granted, this is far more true the longer you travel for and the more committed you are to saving money, and it will also vary by region. However, once you do enough expensive activities and buy one too many overpriced “meh” meals, you start to naturally become less interested in these types of things. For me, these lessons have been priceless. Being able to see various new countries on the cheap and with minimal effort makes the entire process that much more interesting and fun.

How to Destress and Slow Down. 
------------------
Perhaps the most rewarding and valuable thing I’ve learned from this trip is the importance of “slowing down”. I don’t mean slowing down the pace of travel, although I’ve found that to be a great thing to do as well. I’m referring more to slowing down the pace of life in general, and not inflicting unnecessary amounts of stress on your life. When I lived in San Francisco before this trip, I was constantly on the go. I commuted an hour or more to work each morning, sat at my desk working furiously for nine to 10 hours and braved the commute back home at the end of the day. I’d then often race over to a restaurant to meet a friend for dinner, or go for a run as the sun was setting only to be met with the need to make a meal at 9pm. I certainly liked elements of my life at the time, which is why I put up with the crazy schedule. But as soon as I stepped away from it, I realized how much happier I was when those stressful elements I had created were no longer there. I’ve learned from this trip that next time around, I’d like to avoid a commute and spend less time stressed out in traffic, for example. Travel teaches you the importance of appreciating your surroundings and not worrying too much about what’s coming next. It helps you re-examine the widely-adopted American notion that it’s necessary to do a million things at once and be as productive as possible. While I’m certainly not advocating forgoing responsibility altogether, ditching all forms of work or not planning for the future, I would say that travel allows you to figure out the lifestyle pace that works best for you.

What Places Are Actually Like. 
------------------
While all the places I’ve visited on this trip have defied my expectations in one way or another, there are two that stand out. Before going to Bolivia, I expected a highly undeveloped country that I wouldn’t want to stay in too long because I would miss the comforts of my developed-world standards. And prior to arriving in Colombia, I expected a dangerous and sketchy place that was not safe for travel and that, while more developed than Bolivia, would offer a standard of living far off from what I was accustomed to. Both of these sets of expectations proved to be incredibly misguided, and I actually found the opposite to be true. Colombia has become my favorite country I’ve visited on this trip, with Bolivia coming in second. Bolivia was scenic, culturally rich and far more developed than expected. Colombia feels just as safe as many places in California. Further, it is perhaps the most interesting place I’ve ever been, and one of the most beautiful. While it’s inevitable that you’ll have preconceived notions about a place before visiting it in person, travel teaches you to let go of these somewhat, and not to let them deter you too much from going there. Of course, safety is an actual concern in many places in the world. While I do think the media can blow things out of proportion, I don’t believe this is true everywhere, and I contend that you cannot ignore certain facts. However, I also feel it’s important to remember that things are often not what they seem, and that opinions shouldn’t be formed until you’ve actually been somewhere yourself. That is the whole idea behind travel, at least in my opinion, and therein lies the beauty of it. It’s important to challenge mental shortcuts and stereotypes, and travel offers a great way to do this.

There are a lot of people doing what you’re doing. 
------------------
One of the greatest impediments to leaving on a long-term travel trip is the societal norms that make you feel as if it’s a mistake. Some people will tell you you’re doing an amazing thing, but there’s still that nagging feeling that what you’re doing is abnormal and potentially detrimental to your future. As soon as you get out there, though, you realize right away that there are so many other people like you. These are people from all different types of backgrounds, but you quickly find that they share a lot of similarities with you. Not only did they also feel the same pressures at home, but they have similar feelings on the liberating and powerful effects travel can have on a person. Once you start talking to these people and hearing their stories, you feel far less alone in your quest to put the normal life trajectory aside for a bit. You realize that you are not weird for wanting to do this, and that anyone who makes you feel that way is only missing out on an amazing opportunity.

So what are you waiting for – get out there and see the world.
